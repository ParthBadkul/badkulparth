            <p>Me and my class mates had done many projects , The main project which I lead
                was "Secure Voice Data transmission Using Modified Rsa"
                The Main object of this project was to encrypt Voice Data commands which are
                given To the Modern IoT devices for making our Lives easier . As big tech giants
                behind these Industries claim that they record our voice data commands for
                There quality Purposes, But this leads to risk of any unwanted third party to get
                access in the servers and get our data, So if the voice Data is encrypted it will
                be little harder for them to get access to our data ,Our project used modified
                RSA for encryption and using SHA 256 hashing Techniques and salting ;
